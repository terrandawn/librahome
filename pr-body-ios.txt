## Problem
The error 'Distribution Certificate is not validated for non-interactive builds' was occurring because EAS Build couldn't validate iOS certificates for non-interactive builds.

## Solution
Updated eas.json with proper iOS credential configuration and created comprehensive fix guide.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated eas.json Configuration:
- Development builds: Added ios.withoutCredentials: true
- Preview builds: Added ios.withoutCredentials: true 
- Production builds: Added ios.credentialsSource: remote

#### 2. Created Fix Guide:
Added fix-ios-certificates.md with comprehensive solutions including:
- EAS managed credentials (recommended for production)
- Local credentials setup
- Non-interactive flag alternatives
- Troubleshooting steps

### Why This Works:
- withoutCredentials: true: Skips certificate validation for development/internal builds
- credentialsSource: remote: Uses EAS-managed credentials for production builds
- Proper configuration: Eliminates certificate validation warnings

### Next Steps:
1. For development/preview builds: Use updated config - no certificate setup needed
2. For production builds: Set up EAS-managed credentials in your EAS dashboard
3. Test builds: Run eas build --profile preview --platform ios to verify fix

This resolves the iOS certificate validation error while maintaining proper security for production builds.
