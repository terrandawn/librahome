## Problem
The error "Unknown option 'fileMapCacheDirectory'" was occurring because this option has been deprecated and removed in Metro 0.82+.

## Solution
Removed the deprecated fileMapCacheDirectory configuration option.

### Change Made:
- Removed: config.fileMapCacheDirectory = cacheDir;
- Kept: config.cacheStores configuration for proper caching

### Why This Works:
- Metro 0.82+ handles file map cache automatically
- The cacheStores configuration provides proper caching functionality
- Removing deprecated options eliminates warning messages

### Additional Note:
The credentials error mentioned in the log (Distribution Certificate is not validated for non-interactive builds) is a separate iOS build issue that needs to be addressed separately through proper certificate provisioning.

This fix resolves the Metro configuration warning while maintaining proper cache functionality.
