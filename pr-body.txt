## Problem
The error "Unknown option 'serializer.fileMapCacheDirectory'" was occurring because the fileMapCacheDirectory was incorrectly placed under the serializer section.

## Solution
Moved fileMapCacheDirectory to the correct location according to Metro documentation:

### Change Made:
- Before: config.serializer.fileMapCacheDirectory = cacheDir;
- After: config.fileMapCacheDirectory = cacheDir;

### Why This Works:
According to the official Metro documentation, fileMapCacheDirectory is a General Option that should be at the root level of the configuration, not under serializer, resolver, transformer, or other sections.

### Verification:
The configuration now follows the correct Metro structure:
- General options at root level
- Section-specific options under their respective sections
- No more "Unknown option" errors

This fix resolves the Metro bundler configuration error and allows builds to proceed normally.
